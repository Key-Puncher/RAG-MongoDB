# Retrieval Augmented Generation

This repo contains code for running Retrieval Augmented Generation with a vector database.

First, read data from pdf files and generate embeddings from them. Then RAG is done over these embeddings. 

To start, install the dependencies and run one of the files `rag.py` or `rag_agentic.py`.
